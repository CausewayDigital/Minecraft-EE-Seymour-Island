books need to include

example of:

# CYPHER or cipher

BOOK 1) alternative example, sometimes mistakes are made to mark a word as being part of a cipher, eg having a comma after every keyword

- 'random' capital letters
- similar cipher example - eg sentence with randomly placed commas 
- things that look like mistakes might be intentional
- find name for type of cipher ? - come back to things
- preculiar mistakes might mean something

2) sounding out phonetic translations into real words (luvlais to lovelace)
     reference to ada lovelace
- robot 2 - international phonetic alphabet
- simple cipher to put it in a different alphabet eg russian or greek
- translation table on accompanying worksheet
- trying saying it aloud
- ADA LOVELACE in this book
Did you know 


3) bible cipher
- bunch of numbers
-line the word is on, the number of the word on the line and the character of that word
-> mayor's speech
- find line/word/speech -> book cipher
---book cipher uses any piece of text shared by both people  
the most common book cipher is a bible cipher
- before the printing press most people had the bible -> 
    -you used to be able to go into your local church and read the book?
    - everyone used to have access as it was so common
    - another common one is the American Declaration of Independance
    - brief example 
        -using a simple sentence 
            -quick brown fox?
    -intro text of robot needs indication that there's been eve's dropping

- tim berner lee


4) caesar cipher
     turing is estimated to have saves over 2mill lifes with his groundbreaking work in computing and cryptography
- turing

-ceaser cipher shifted by 10
-robot: did u know its 10 billion lightyears to andromeda galaxy.... anyway

- spot because the formatting is similar to a normal sentence.
letters are gibberish
- can brute force, but thats slower, it will be much quicker to look for the key 
- letter frequencies / or use code convertors
- the key might be in the same place as the ciphertext 
-often key sent with the ciphertext :)
- an example of a substitution cipher 
    - eg. true random substitution - any letter connected to any other letter : freq analysis to break, or break by word length 
- easy to send decryption key subtley
- true random is harder for ur recipient to decode

---


5) transposition cipher (Columnar transposition)
     write ciphertext down n characters then move to next coloumb, plaintext will appear leftoright

- column transposition cipher
- already has all the letters you need just in the wrong order - like an anagram with a full sentence not just one word
- column t cipher 
    - write your text 5 characters at a time 
    - key is how many characters along until you wrap around
    - ex is 8x8 but could be rectangle instead of square

- 2 or 3 examples so they see it

- lesson is that they exist
- formatting scrambling
- simple generation of ciphertext but so difficult to decrypt 
- just looks like gibberish
- hard to work it out if you didn't know
- doesnt even look like words
- just reordering current information :) 

    robot text - noahs eight by eight
    eight days and nights
    or eight

->grace hopper
-hardest cipher

grace hopper, tim berner lee, katherine johnson (+ team of computers), turing, adalovelace, 


- need seperate teacher worksheet and how you get to the solutions
- explicit version of the above

    Building
        Robots secret base (need to consult sam for lore)

        Remove archive to avoid confusion
        Furnish robot 3's house and maybe block off the other open house

    Functions for input
        Scoreboard that keeps track of correct letters and accepts answer as correct if all letter are correct (and therefore the scoreboard it at its highest value)
        If you get it wrong have a title pop up for you telling you you got it wrong, (maybe a cooldown before you can try again or maybe teleport you back to the fountain)

    Worksheet
        Map so kids can mark off the location of robots they've found
        Phonetic Alphabet
        Grid for the transposition cipher
        Place to write all the code words

1. do the text 
2. do the code history background
3. snags + send it over

-> Grace Hopper

One of the most important skills for a codebreaker is to be able to spot patterns and inconsistencies. 
When someone is sending a secret message they might put clues in unexpected places or in unexpected ways. 

Key terms:
Cipher - A cipher is a method of obscuring information, in this puzzle there are five examples, 
    but there are countless different ciphers and variations.
Plaintext - This is the term we use for the secret message in it's normal form.
Ciphertext - This is the term we use for the message when it has been obscured in some way using a cipher.
Key - This is the term we use for the number or rule which cracks the cipher, this is the hidden piece of information which acts like a key in a lock for the secret message.

Can you work out what the hidden message is?
Remember: Sometimes a mistake is not a mistake but an intentional message :)

Ciphertext: Bigg rred eaars are cceertain signs  thhat yoou might pposess ppurplee elven rrelatives.

Key: The key here is the rule that you should make a note of every time a letter is repeated (not including letters which normally repeat like the s in posess)
Plaintext: grace hopper 

Wait who is Grace Hopper?

Glad you asked. 

she! type pillow helped! snail they write! football code! draw that! dog 
post sent! letter people! wrists to! lamps sunshine the! moon!

Solution:
she helped write code that sent people to the moon

--------- Book 2 ---------------------

Hola! One way to change a communication is to send it in different language. 
That can work if only the people you want to know the message understand that language,
but nowadays we can use the internet to translate most languages. That can lead people to use more obscure languages,
or to make up their own.

eg. piglatin 
eg. leetspeak :)


What if we didn't use a different language, but instead used a different alphabet?

Here's a made up example:

βοθκ, ΓΘβοτ, ρξτΣ -> could become -> book, robot, pete. 
This example uses the greek alphabet. To an english speaker we might think that the Greek letter ξ looks like a capital E,
but to a greek speaker they know that letter to be the greek symbol for Xi, the equivalent of X, so those are just nonsense phrases to them. 


 α 	Alpha 	a 	
Β 	β 	Beta 	b 	
Γ 	γ 	Gamma 	g 	
Δ 	δ 	Delta 	d 	
Ε 	ε 	Epsilon 	e 	
Ζ 	ζ 	Zeta 	z 	
Η 	η 	Eta 	h 	
Θ 	θ 	Theta 	th 	
Ι 	ι 	Iota 	i 	
Κ 	κ 	Kappa 	k 	
Λ 	λ 	Lambda 	l 	
Μ 	μ 	Mu 	m 	
Ν 	ν 	Nu 	n 	
Ξ 	ξ 	Xi 	x 	
Ο 	ο 	Omicron 	o 	
Π 	π 	Pi 	p 	
Ρ 	ρ 	Rho 	r 	
Σ 	σ,ς * 	Sigma 	s 	
Τ 	τ 	Tau 	t 	
Υ 	υ 	Upsilon 	u 	
Φ 	φ 	Phi 	ph 	
Χ 	χ 	Chi 	ch 	
Ψ 	ψ 	Psi 	ps 	
Ω 	ω

--------- Book 3 ---------------------
I am sure someone will notice if I keep sending long scrambled messages...
Instead of sending you all the information you needed to break a code, what if I relied on the information I knew you already had?
This is what this next type of cipher does. Here is an example:

If I knew you had just read the lines above this, what might the following mean: 

Key:
2:16 1:2 1:10 2:4 2:7 3:10

Solution:
I am sending you information here

Each pair of numbers matches to a line and to a word on that line, eg: 1:2 is the first line and the second word, so I.

This is called the book cipher. In the book cipher there might be another number in each code to indicate the page as well.
This relies on both the sender and reciever having the same book or piece of text with which to communicate with.
This can also be called the bible cipher because historically the bible has been such an accessible text, but other examples of text used for this cipher
includ the American Declaration of Independance as well as the Oxford English Dictionary.

Another example:

Ciphertext: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
Key: 1:2 1:3 8:1 9:2
Plaintext: hello

This example changes what each number refers to. This time it indicates the word and then the letter in the word.
eg 1:2 is the first word, second letter - aka h

The strength of the cipher is that you can pre-agree the text before hand and then even if someone finds the key, they still have no idea which book to try to use it on.
